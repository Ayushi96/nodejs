## airbnb clone using Node JS

I have added the notes in the explanaiton.md file in some of the lessons. Remaining code contains in-line comments that should be a good guide to refresh and learn Node JS and express. 

The MVC concept is also explained clearly. 


This repo follows the course on Node Js by Prashant Jain.
